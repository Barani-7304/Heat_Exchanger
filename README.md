Heat Exchanger Design & Analysis Application

This repository contains the source code for a Heat Exchanger Design and Analysis Application, aimed at simplifying the process of designing, rating, and analyzing various types of heat exchangers.

ðŸ“Œ Overview

The application is being built to :

Perform preliminary thermal design of heat exchangers.

Carry out rating calculations based on given process data.

Analyze the performance of different heat exchanger configurations.

Currently, the focus is on Shell-and-Tube Heat Exchangers using the Bell-Delaware Method for shell-side calculations.

ðŸš§ Current Development Status

âœ… Completed:

Basic structure of the application.

Input data handling and UI framework.

Calculation of Heat Duty and LMTD

Tube-side calculations

ðŸ”¨ In Progress:

Shell-side code development using the Bell-Delaware method (accounts for baffle leakage, bypass streams, and correction factors).

Integration of shell-side calculations with the overall thermal design workflow.

ðŸ“… Upcoming:

Tube-side calculations.

Pressure drop estimations.

Visualization tools for heat exchanger geometry and results
